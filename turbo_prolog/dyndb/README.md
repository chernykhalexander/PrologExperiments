### Dynamic database

This simple prototype allows to search for a flats in Prague.

Facts are stored in external db.
When the program starts, these facts are consulted.

You can do simple things with facts:

- add a flat
- delete a flat
- find a flat
- find all flats in a given district
- quit :-)

A lot of things need to be implemented yet:
- screen layout
- instead of manually typing I would rather limit the allowed values
- fulltext search

Program implemented in Turbo Prolog 2.0.
